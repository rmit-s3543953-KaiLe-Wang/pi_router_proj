# pi_router_proj

One of my school project.
It's a simple raspberry pi router that can be used as a wireless access point, and a web server. 
It takes Ethernet/USB as network input, then broadcast the signal as a wifi AP.
The web server will read current USB inputs (USB drive for example), then display the content of the USB input on the web page.

The code in the repo doesn't include the circuit board design file as well as the installation script of each used framework.
